#References and Interesting Sites for Continuing

##Links to Ruby documentation:

These will provide listings of methods and classes as well as all the
information you can imagine wanting for the Ruby language. Of course,
they are documentation sites so are more useful for looking up specific
questions or classes.

###[ruby-lang.org/en/documentation](http://ruby-lang.org/en/documentation)  

This link has a lot of links to other sites, books and tutorials.

###[ruby-doc.org](http://ruby-doc.org)

This is the cut and dry documentation site where you can find giant
collections of all you need to know about the objects you've been using
in the class. A good example of what you can find here is seen on the
page for [Arrays](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.html).

##Books, tutorials and practice

###[Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com)

A collection of unit tests made by EdgeCase that you fill in blanks to make
pass and explore features of the language and lessons while doing so.


###[Hackety Hack](http://hackety-hack.com)

A guide for absolute beginner programmers (much will be things you've
already learned). However, it also coveres GUI and web programming so it
might be helpful.


###[Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby book](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/)

An introductory book to the Ruby language, written by a guy who went by
the name of "why the lucky stiff". This is a very unusual book full of
strange humor and silly side tracked stories and comics. However, this
means the book won't be dry as long as his sense of humor works for you.

###[Ruby Quiz](http://www.rubyquiz.com/)

The ruby quiz is a site full of puzzles to solve with Ruby. Each one has
an explanation and solution to compare your approach to when you finish.
This is a really good way to practice if you are unsure of what to try
building.
