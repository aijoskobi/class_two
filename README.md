#References and Interesting Sites for Continuing

##Links to Ruby documentation

These will provide listings of methods and classes as well as all the
information you can imagine wanting for the Ruby language. Of course,
they are documentation sites so are more useful for looking up specific
questions or classes.

###[ruby-lang.org/en/documentation](http://ruby-lang.org/en/documentation)

This link has a lot of links to other sites, books and tutorials.

###[ruby-doc.org](http://ruby-doc.org)

This is the cut and dry documentation site where you can find giant
collections of all you need to know about the objects you've been using
in the class. A good example of what you can find here is seen on the
page for [Arrays](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.html).

##Books, tutorials and practice

###[Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com)

A collection of unit tests made by EdgeCase that you fill in blanks to make
pass and explore features of the language and lessons while doing so.

###[Hackety Hack](http://hackety-hack.com)

A guide for absolute beginner programmers (much will be things you've
already learned). However, it also coveres GUI and web programming so it
might be helpful.

###[Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby book](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/)

An introductory book to the Ruby language, written by a guy who went by
the name of "why the lucky stiff". This is a very unusual book full of
strange humor and silly side tracked stories and comics. However, this
means the book won't be dry as long as his sense of humor works for you.

###[Ruby Quiz](http://www.rubyquiz.com/)

The ruby quiz is a site full of puzzles to solve with Ruby. Each one has
an explanation and solution to compare your approach to when you finish.
This is a really good way to practice if you are unsure of what to try
building.

###[The Ruby Object Model](http://pragprog.com/screencasts/v-dtrubyom/the-ruby-object-model-and-metaprogramming)

The first two screencasts come highly recommended. They are "Episode 1: Objects and Classes"
and "Episode 2: Sharing Behavior". These might be a bit advanced so if you don't understand
all of the concepts talked about on the first viewing, watch again later after you've learned
more.

###[PeepCode screencasts](http://peepcode.com/)

PeepCode is a website full of great screencasts covering all kinds of content.
Screencasts cost $12 each, though, but are often well worth the cost.

##Want to try making a website?

Ruby on Rails is the most popular and talked about framework for building
websites in Ruby. While there are several other good options, this is the one
most have heard of. There will be a fall session of Girl Develop It covering this,
but if you this is something you want to start working with now take a look at
some of the links below.

###[Ruby on Rails site](http://rubyonrails.org/)

This is the main site of the Ruby on Rails project. You can find the installation
information and there are a lot of links here but it might not be the best place to get started.

###[Agile Web Development with Rails (book)](http://pragprog.com/titles/rails3/agile-web-development-with-rails)

This book was published by the same people who published Learn to Program that
we used for our class. It is an excellent book that will walk you through building
a shopping cart site.

###[Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/)

This site has a collection of screencasts (that cost money) and a free online book
that covers the same material. A great starting point if you don't want to purchase
the Agile Web Development book.

###[PeepCode's Meet Rails 3 screencasts](http://peepcode.com/products/meet-rails-3-i)

PeepCode screencasts are in general a great learning resource. This series will walk you
through building a Rails application.

###[Rails for Zombies](http://railsforzombies.org/)

Rails for Zombies is a silly interactive screencast series that guide you through building
a twitter site for zombies to share information on the location of tasty brains. In this you
watch a screencast then perform a set of exercises inside your browser related to what was
just covered. A great hands on way to begin learning since you don't even need to install
anything.
